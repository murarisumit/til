# Gerund vs Gerundio 


In spanish typically uses `-iendo/-ando` form only when you are literally doing that thing *RIGHT* now. 

So in english, we might be at party and someone might ask, `what are you studying`, In spanish it would be `que estudia?`. Unless they interrupt you while you are physicallly studying.

In english the `gerund` or "-ing" form is a verbal noun, and it translated in Spanish with the infinitive. The `gerundio` or `-ndo` form in spanish in never a noun. 

It can be an adverb or combined with "estar" to make the progressive tenses. 

To say "what are you studying?" in spanish with progressive, you have to include "estas", like `que estas estudiando?` not `que estudiando`(because it's missing a verb)
